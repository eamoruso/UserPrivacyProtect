# User Privacy Protection via Windows Registry Hooking and Real-Time Encryption

# Abstract
The Windows registry contains a plethora of information in a hierarchical database. It includes system-wide settings, user preferences, installed programs, and recently accessed files and maintains timestamps that can be used to construct a detailed timeline of user activities. However, these data are unencrypted and thus vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors who gain access to this repository. To address this security and privacy concern, we propose a novel approach that efficiently encrypts and decrypts sensitive registry data in real time. Our developed proof-of-concept program intercepts interactions between the registry’s application programming interfaces (APIs) and other Windows applications using an advanced hooking technique. This enables the proposed system to be transparent to users without requiring any changes to the operating system or installed software. Our approach also implements the data protection API (DPAPI) developed by Microsoft to securely manage each user’s encryption key. Ultimately, our research provides an enhanced security and privacy framework for the Windows registry, effectively fortifying the registry against security and privacy threats while maintaining its accessibility to legitimate users and applications.
